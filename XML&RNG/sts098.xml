    Space Shuttle Atlantis spent almost 13 days in orbit, with seven of those days docked to the International Space Station. While at the orbital outpost, the STS-98 crew delivered and activated the U.S. Laboratory named Destiny and completed three space walks.
    
    Arrival of the Destiny Lab brought the space station's mass to about 101.6 metric tons (112 tons), surpassing that of the Russian Mir space station for the first time.
    
    Installation of the new U.S. Laboratory named Destiny greatly increased the habitable volume of the space station. The cylindrical module is 8.5 meters (28 feet) long and 4.3 meters (14 feet) in diameter.
    Crew consisted of Commander Kenneth Cockrell, Pilot Mark Polansky, Mission Specialists Robert Curbeam, Thomas Jones and Marsha Ivins.
