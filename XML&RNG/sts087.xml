    STS-87
    Mission: USMP-4; Spartan 201-04
    Space Shuttle: Columbia
    Launch Pad: 39B
    Launched: November 19, 1997, 2:46:00 p.m. EST
    Landing Site: Kennedy Space Center, Florida
    Landing: December 5, 1997, 7:20:04 a.m. EST
    Mission Duration: 15 days, 16 hours, 34 minutes, 4 seconds
    Orbit Altitude: 150 nautical miles
    Orbit Inclination: 28.45 degrees
    
    Primary payload of the flight, the U.S. Microgravity Payload-4, performed well. Research using other major payload, SPARTAN-201-04 free-flyer, was not completed.
    
    SPARTAN deploy delayed one day to Nov. 21 to allow time for companion spacecraft, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) already on-orbit, to come back on-line. Chawla used orbiter's mechanical arm to release SPARTAN at 4:04 p.m. Spacecraft failed to execute a pirouette maneuver several minutes later, suggesting there was a problem with the attitude control system for fine pointing toward solar targets. Chawla then regrappled the SPARTAN, but did not receive a firm capture indication. When she backed the arm away once more, a rotational spin of about two degrees per second was apparently imparted to the satellite. Kregel tried to match the satellite's rotation by firing Columbia's thrusters for a second grapple attempt, but this was called off by the flight director.
    
    After a plan was formulated to retrieve the free-flyer, Scott and Doi began a seven-hour, 43-minute space walk Nov. 24 and captured the SPARTAN by hand at 9:09 p.m. EST. The two astronauts then completed a series of activities that continue preparations for on-orbit assembly of the International Space Station. Doi became the first Japanese citizen to walk in space.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Kevin R. Kregel, Pilot Steven W. Lindsey, Mission Specialists Winston E. Scott, Kalpana Chawla, Takao Doi and Leonid K. Kadenyuk.
