    This was the first flight to include two women, Ride and Sullivan. Sullivan was the first American woman to walk in space. The Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) was deployed less than nine hours into the flight. The Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications-3 (OSTA-3) carried three experiments in the payload bay. Components of Orbital Refueling System (ORS) were connected, demonstrating it is possible to refuel satellites in orbit. Other Payloads were: Large Format Camera (LFC); IMAX Camera, flying for the third time; a package of Canadian Experiments (CANEX); Auroral Photography Experiment (APE); Radiation Monitoring Equipment (RME); Thermoluminiscent Dosimeter (TLD); and eight Get Away Specials.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Robert L. Crippen, Pilot Jon A. McBride, Mission Specialists Kathryn D. Sullivan, Sally K. Ride, David C. Leestma and Payload Specialists Marc Garneau and Paul D. Scully-Power.
