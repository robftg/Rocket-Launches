    Discovery's seven-member Return to Flight crew arrived at the International Space Station on July 28. The crewmembers' primary objectives were to test and evaluate new safety procedures and conduct assembly and maintenance tasks on the Station. A late addition to the timeline tasked the crew with first ever on-orbit repair of the Shuttle heat shield.
    
    Two crewmembers, Steve Robinson and Soichi Noguchi, ventured outside the Shuttle three times on spacewalks.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Eileen Collins, Pilot James Kelly, Mission Specialists Charles Camarda, Wendy Lawrence, Soichi Noguchi, Stephen Robinson and Andrew Thomas.
