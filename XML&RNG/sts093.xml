    STS-93
    Mission: Chandra X-Ray Observatory Deployment
    Space Shuttle: Columbia
    Launch Pad: 39B
    Launched: July 22, 1999, 11:31 p.m. CDT
    Launch Window: 116 minutes
    Landing: July 27, 1999, 10:20 pm CDT
    Mission Duration: 4 days, 22 hours, 50 minutes
    
    The purpose of the five-day mission was to deploy the Chandra X-Ray Observatory.
    
    However, when Columbia reached orbit, it was 11 kilometers (7 miles) short of its target. This was due to premature main engine cutoff an instant before the scheduled cutoff. Columbia eventually reached its proper altitude and continued its mission.
    
    On Flight Day 1, the shuttle crew successfully deployed Chandra. The observatory was propelled into orbit by a two-stage Inertial Upper Stage, or IUS.
    
    During the rest of the mission the crew activated secondary payloads and experiments, including the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System which was used to capture ultraviolet imagery of Earth, the Moon, Mercury, Venus and Jupiter.
    
    With the launch of STS-93 on July 22, 1999, Col. Eileen Collins became the first woman to command a space shuttle mission.
    
    Commander Eileen M. Collins, Pilot Jeffrey S. Ashby, Mission Specialists Steven A. Hawley, Catherine G. Coleman and Michel Tognini.
