    STS-4
    Mission: Department of Defense/Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES)
    Space Shuttle: Columbia
    Launch Pad: 39A
    Launched: June 27, 1982 at 11:00:00 a.m. EDT
    Landing Site: Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
    Landing: July 4, 1982 at 9:09:31 a.m. PDT
    Mission Duration: 7 days, 1 hour, 9 minutes and 31 seconds
    Orbit Altitude: 197 nautical miles
    Orbit Inclination: 28.5 degrees
    
    The Final Space Transportation System research and development flight. In addition to classified Department of Defense payload, cargo included first Get Away Specials, (G-001) which contained nine experiments from Utah State University; first commercial experiment involving Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES); Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR); Induced Environment Contamination Monitor (IECM), which was deployed, and two Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) experiments. Crew performed medical experiments on themselves for two student projects, operated remote manipulator arm to swing IECM around orbiter, and took photos of lightning activity in Earth's atmosphere. Two solid rocket booster casings were lost when main parachutes failed and they impacted the water and sank. Some rainwater penetrated protective coating of several tiles while orbiter on pad. On orbit, affected area turned toward sun and water vaporized, preventing further tile damage from freezing water.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Thomas K. Mattingly II and Pilot Henry W. Hartsfield, Jr.
