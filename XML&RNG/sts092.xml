    STS-92 took its place in history Oct. 11, 2000, when Space Shuttle Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Fla., to begin the 100th flight of the space shuttle program.
    
    During STS-92, the crew delivered and installed the Z1 Truss and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 to the International Space Station.
    
    Onboard were seven astronauts â€” Commander Brian Duffy, Pilot Pam Melroy and Mission Specialists Leroy Chiao, Bill McArthur, Koichi Wakata, Jeff Wisoff and Mike Lopez-Alegria. Wakata represented the National Space Development Agency of Japan, or NASDA, for the second time in his career. During STS-72 in 1996, he became the first NASDA astronaut to fly as a mission specialist aboard the space shuttle.
