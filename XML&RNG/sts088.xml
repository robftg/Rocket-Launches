    STS-88, the 13th flight of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, began the largest international cooperative space venture in history as it attached together in orbit the first two modules of the International Space Station. STS-88 was the first human International Space Station assembly flight.
    
    The primary mission objective was to rendezvous with the already launched Zarya Control Module and successfully attach the Unity Node, providing the foundation for future station components.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Robert D. Cabana, Pilot Frederick W. Sturckow, Mission Specialists Nancy J. Currie, Jerry L. Ross, James H. Newman and Sergei K. Krikalev.
