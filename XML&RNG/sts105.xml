    Space Shuttle Discovery spent 12 days in orbit, with eight of those days docked to the International Space Station. While at the orbital outpost, the STS-105 crew attached the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, transferred supplies and equipment to the station, completed two space walks and deployed a small spacecraft called Simplesat.
    
    Discovery delivered the Expedition Three crew — Commander Frank Culbertson, Pilot Vladimir Dezhurov and Flight Engineer Mikhail Tyurin — for its extended stay aboard the space station. It returned to Earth with Expedition Two crewmembers Commander Yury Usachev and Flight Engineers Jim Voss and Susan Helms who had spent about five months living on the station.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Scott Horowitz, Pilot Rick Sturckow, Mission Specialists Daniel Barry and Patrick Forrester.
