    STS-72
    Mission: SFU; OAST-Flyer
    Space Shuttle: Endeavour
    Launch Pad: 39B
    Launched: January 11, 1996, 4:41:00 a.m. EST
    Landing Site: Kennedy Space Center, Florida
    Landing: January 20, 1996, 2:41:41 a.m. EST
    Mission Duration: 8 days, 22 hours, 1 minute, 47 seconds
    Orbit Altitude: 250 nautical miles
    Orbit Inclination: 28.45 degrees
    
    First shuttle flight of 1996 highlighted by retrieval of a Japanese satellite, deployment and retrieval of a NASA science payload, and two spacewalks.
    
    Mission Specialist Wakata operated remote manipulator system arm on flight day three to pluck Japanese Space Flyer Unit (SFU) from orbit, completing 10-month scientific mission involving almost a dozen experiments ranging from materials science to biological studies. Both solar arrays on SFU had to be jettisoned prior to retrieval when sensors indicated improper latching following retraction.
    
    On flight day four, Wakata again operated Endeavour's robot arm, this time to deploy Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology-Flyer (OAST-Flyer), sending experiment-laden platform on its way to a two-day free-flight at a distance of approximately 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the orbiter.  OAST-Flyer retrieved on flight day six, with Wakata again operating the remote manipulator system arm to retrieve the platform.
    
    Two extravehicular activities (EVAs) conducted as part of continuing series to prepare for on-orbit construction of International Space Station. During first EVA on flight day five lasting 6 hours, nine minutes, Mission Specialists Chiao and Barry evaluated new portable work platform and a structure known as the rigid umbilical, which may be used on station to hold various fluid and electrical lines.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Brian Duffy, Pilot Brent W. Jett, Mission Specialists Leroy Chiao, Daniel T. Barry, Winston E. Scott and Koichi Wakata.
