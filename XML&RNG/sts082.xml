    STS-82
    Mission: Second HST Servicing
    Space Shuttle: Discovery
    Launch Pad: 39A
    Launched: February 11, 1997 3:55:17 a.m. EST
    Landing Site: Kennedy Space Center, Florida
    Landing: February 21, 1997, 3:32 a.m. EST
    Mission Duration: 9 days, 23 hours, 37 minutes, 9 seconds
    Orbit Altitude: 360 statute miles
    Orbit Inclination: 28.45 degrees
    
    STS-82 demonstrated anew the capability of the space shuttle to service orbiting spacecraft as well as the benefits of human spaceflight. A six-member crew completed servicing and upgrading of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) during four planned extravehicular activities (EVAs) and then performed a fifth unscheduled space walk to repair insulation on the telescope.
    
    Discovery's maneuvering jets fired several times during the mission to reboost the telescope's orbit by eight nautical miles. Hubble redeployed on Feb. 19 at 1:41 a.m. and is now operating at the highest altitude it has ever flown, a 335- by 321-nautical-mile orbit. Initial checkout of new instruments and equipment during mission showed all were performing nominally. Calibration of two new science instruments was to take place over a period of several weeks with first images and data anticipated in about 8 to 10 weeks. Two more servicing are missions planned for 1999 and 2002.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Kenneth D. Bowersox, Pilot Scott J. Horowitz, Mission Specialists Mark C. Lee, Steven A. Hawley, Gregory J. Harbaugh, Steven L. Smith and Joseph R. Tanner.
