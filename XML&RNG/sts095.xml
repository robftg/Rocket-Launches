    During STS-95, the crew of Space Shuttle Discovery spent nine days in orbit successfully completing a large variety of experiments, including investigations in the astronomical, human physiology and physical science fields. A SPACEHAB module in the shuttle's payload bay provided a complete pressurized laboratory and work space for the crew's science activities.
    
    Discovery launched Oct. 29, 1998, with a seven-member crew: Commander Curt Brown, Pilot Steven Lindsey, Mission Specialists Scott Parazynski, Pedro Duque and Stephen Robinson and Payload Specialists Chiaki Mukai and John Glenn.
