    Space Shuttle Atlantis' flight to the International Space Station included several milestones. First, STS-110 delivered the S0 (S-Zero) Truss — the first of nine pieces that will make up the station's external framework that will eventually consist of nine pieces and stretch 109 meters (356 feet).
    
    STS-110 Mission Specialist Jerry Ross became the first human to be launched into space seven times. With the two spacewalks that he performed, he tightened his grip on the most U.S. spacewalks (nine) and spacewalking time — 58 hours, 18 minutes.
    
    The mission had other spacewalk milestones. This was the first time that the station's robotic arm was used to maneuver spacewalkers around the station, and it was the first time that all of a shuttle crew's spacewalks were based out the station's Quest Airlock.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Michael J. Bloomfield, Pilot Stephen N. Frick, Mission Specialists Jerry L. Ross, Steven L. Smith, Ellen Ochoa, Lee M. E. Morin and Rex J. Walheim.
