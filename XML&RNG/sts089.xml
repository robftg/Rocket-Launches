    Mission: Eighth Shuttle-Mir Docking
    Space Shuttle: Endeavour
    Launch Pad: 39A
    Launched: January 22, 1998, 9:48:15 p.m. EST
    Landing Site: Kennedy Space Center, Florida
    Landing: January 31, 1998, 5:35:09 p.m. EST
    Mission Duration: 8 days, 19 hours, 46 minutes, 54 seconds
    
    Docking of Endeavour to Mir occurred at 3:14 p.m., Jan. 24, at an altitude of 214 nautical miles. Hatches opened at 5:25 p.m. the same day. Transfer of Andy Thomas to Mir and return of David Wolf to the U.S. orbiter occurred at 6:35 p.m., Jan. 25. Initially, Thomas thought his Sokol pressure suit did not fit, and the crew exchange was allowed to proceed only after Wolf's suit was adjusted to fit Thomas. Once on Mir, Thomas was able to make adequate adjustments to his own suit (which would be worn should the crew need to return to Earth in the Soyuz capsule) and this remained on Mir with him. Wolf spent a total of 119 days aboard Mir, and after landing his total on-orbit time was 128 days.
    More than 8,000 pounds (3,629 kilograms) of scientific equipment, logistical hardware and water were taken from Endeavour to Mir.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Terrence W. Wilcutt, Pilot Joe F. Edwards, Jr., Payload Commander Bonnie J. Dunbar, Mission Specialists Michael P. Anderson, James F. Reilly, Salizhan Shakirovich Sharipov and Andrew S. W. Thomas.
