    STS-46
    Mission: TSS-1; EURECA Deploy
    Space Shuttle: Atlantis
    Launch Pad: 39B
    Launched: July 31, 1992, 9:56:48 a.m. EDT
    Landing Site: Kennedy Space Center, Florida
    Landing: August 8, 1992, 9:11:51 a.m. EDT
    Mission Duration: 7 days, 23 hours, 15 minutes, 3 seconds
    Orbit Altitude: 230 nautical miles
    Orbit Inclination: 28.45 degrees
    
    The primary objective was deployment of the European Space Agency's European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA) and operation of the joint NASA/Italian Space Agency Tethered Satellite System (TSS). The mission was extended one day to complete the science objectives. EURECA deployed one day later than scheduled because of problem with its data handling system. After deployment, the spacecraft's thrusters were fired to boost EURECA to its planned operating altitude of about 310 statute miles (499 kilometers). However, the thruster firing was cut to six minutes instead of the planned 24 minutes because of unexpected attitude data from EURECA. The problem resolved and EURECA was boosted to operational orbit on the sixth day of the mission. The payload was to be retrieved on STS-57 in 1993.
    
    TSS deployment was also delayed one day because of EURECA. During TSS deployment, the satellite reached a maximum distance of only 840 feet (256 meters) from orbiter instead of planned 12.5 miles (20 kilometers) because of a jammed tether line. After numerous attempts over several days to free the tether, TSS operations were curtailed and satellite was stowed for return to Earth.
    
    Crew consisted of Commander Loren J. Shriver, Pilot Andrew M. Allen, Mission Specialists Jeffrey A. Hoffman, Franklin R. Chang-Diaz, Claude Nicollier, Marsha S. Ivins and Payload Specialist Franco Malerba.
